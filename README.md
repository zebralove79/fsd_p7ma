# Udacity Full-Stack Development course - Map Application Project

## Introduction
This single page application features a map of lunch places (and one coffee place) around my workplace. I had something similar in mind when I started working at my company, because I think it is always hard for newcomers to know where you could go out to eat. Google Maps is helpful, but a list curated by co-workers is simply more trustworthy :).

## Instructions
1. Clone the repo
2. Enter your foursquare client id and client secret in the main.js file (URLPARAMS variable)
3. Provide your Google Maps API key in main.js (GMAPSKEY variable)
4. Open the index.html file
5. Play around with the map

## Acknowledgements
Several resources were used in the making of this app:
- Boostrap and its documentation and offcanvas menu example
- Foursquare and its documentation
- Google Maps API and its documentation
- jQuery and its documentation
- KnockoutJS and its documentation
- http://www.knockmeout.net/2011/04/utility-functions-in-knockoutjs.html helped me get a grip on KnockoutJS' utility functions (the entry is really old the functions have changed, but that article gives you a good indication nonetheless)
- last, but very much not least: a stack of Stack Overflow answers

## Note
The application was tested for responsiveness using Chrome's built-in developers tools. It was not tested on actual devices (mostly due to a lack of such devices).

## Todos
- implement JSON parser for lunch place list
- allow creation of new map entries
